# 📊 Climate Change & Genocide in Gaza 

Welcome to our Data Science project repository. This project is divided into two major parts that explore the applications of data science in two critical real-world contexts: **climate change** and the **ongoing genocide in Gaza**.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

### Part A: Climate Change – Temperatures and Precipitation
In this part, we explore real climate data to identify long-term trends in temperature and precipitation. Using techniques from data science and statistical inference, we:
- Clean and prepare raw climate datasets.
- Visualize temporal and seasonal changes.
- Apply hypothesis testing to analyze climate phenomena.
- Draw inferences from natural processes using simulation and random sampling.

### Part B: Genocide in Gaza – Telling the Story through Data
This part applies data science to the urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza since October 7th, 2023. Using official datasets on casualties, infrastructure damage, and more, we:
- Preprocess and clean multiple datasets (CSV, JSON, PDF).
- Visualize key patterns and events from the data.
- Pose and test hypotheses using statistical techniques.
- Present powerful narratives backed by data, raising awareness and documenting the impact of the genocide.

## 📁 Datasets Used

### Climate Change
- Global temperature and precipitation datasets from Berkeley Earth and related sources.

### Genocide in Gaza
- `daily-casualties-gaza.csv`
- `daily-casualties-westbank.csv`
- `killed-in-gaza.csv` (converted from PDF)
- `infrastructure-damaged.csv` (converted from JSON)
- Additional PDF: `killed-in-gaza_moh_2025-03-23.pdf` (used for extended analysis)

## 📊 Visualizations and Analyses

- Line and bar plots of daily and monthly casualties.
- Histograms of infrastructure damage.
- Overlay charts showing correlations.
- Aggregated statistics by gender, age group, region, and time.
- Hypothesis tests comparing means between Gaza and West Bank, trends before/after major events, and more.
